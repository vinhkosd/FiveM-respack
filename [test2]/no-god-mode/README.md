#### What is this?
This is a resource that prevents users from being able to run around, shoot, drive, whatever whilst they are in god mode.

#### An example of where this might be useful.
You're on a deathmatch server and, for some reason, scripthook is enabled and a user comes on the server, enables god mode, and starts ruining the deathmatch and they're at an unfair advantage. This script will freeze the player and the vehicle (if they are in one), and prevent them from shooting.
