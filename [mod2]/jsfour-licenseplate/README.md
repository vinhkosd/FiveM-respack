# jsfour-licenseplate
A script that lets you create your own license plate and apply it to the nearest car

## LICENSE
Please don't sell or reupload this resource

## INSTALLATION
* You need to have <a href="https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended">ESX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_vehicleshop">esx_vehicleshop</a> installed.
* Rename the folder to **jsfour-licenseplate**
* Run the SQL file

## USAGE
You need to add a license plate to a shop or whatever. (The license plate is a usable item).

You need to apply it to a player owned car and the number can't be in the database already, so if it says you can't apply the plate that might be the reason why.
